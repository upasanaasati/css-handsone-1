            <li>Css stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
            <li>Css describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on the screen, paper,or in other media.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="lt">Css is not necessary</span><span class="bg">CSS saves a lot of work.</span><span> the
                    layout of multiple web pages all at once</span>
            </li>
            <li id="demo">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <div class="con">
        <ul>
            <li>Inline - by using the style attributes inside HTML elements</li>
            <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
            <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS files.</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS, is also keep the style in external CSS files.However,<span id="bg">in
                    this
                    <br>tutorial we will use inline an internal styles,</span>because to demonstrate, and easier<br>
                for you try it yourself.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>When compring CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class aplies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the
        other hand,applies
        <br> a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link
        directly to an element and it's used by
        <br> Javascript.
    </p>
    <p>In CSS,selectors are used to target specific element or range of element on web page.Once an element has been
        targeted,a style or
        <br>set of styles can be applied to the element
    </p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to
        target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
